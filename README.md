# IPTV Data Harmonization System

**Version:** 2025-09-21  
**Author:** Andrew Pearen  
**Purpose:** Unify fragmented M3U and EPG sources into a reproducible, config-driven pipeline for IPTV apps like Tivimate.

## Goals
- Normalize and reconcile M3U and EPG data from multiple sources
- Apply consistent naming conventions (e.g., `US-ABC-WXYZ (Detroit)`)
- Enable config-driven transformation, grouping, and filtering
- Support GUI for mapping, rule editing, and preview
- Ensure reproducibility, auditability, and future-proofing

## Architecture Summary
See `hld.md` for full design.
